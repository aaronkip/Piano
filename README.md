#Piano
This is a piano flutter application.

## What I aim at Achieving
I will have better understanding of these in flutter when I'm done wit the project:
- Working with dark mode
- Working with custom files bundled with the app
- Working with midi sounds in flutter
- Using Semantics
- Minimal code usage
